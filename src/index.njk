                     My name is Samuel HÃ¥kans Persson and I recently graduated from Karlstad 
                     University as a computer engineer. Now I am searching for a fullfilling
                     job where I can contribute with my creativity and drive, while continuing
                     to grow as a person and developer.<br><br>

                  This website will serve as an introduction to who I am and what I'm looking for, 
                  as well as a portfolio for both my technological and creative projects.
